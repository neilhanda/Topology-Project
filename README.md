# Topology-Project
Implementation of Morse Smale Complex constructiona and visualisation using Python libraries NumPy and Matplotlib

Please go through this link for a video demonstration of our code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdRjNz3Gycg
------------------------
REQUIREMENTS TO RUN CODE
------------------------

Please make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the code.
To run the file named -"BuildMorseSmaleComplex.py", you need to have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

1)numpy
2)matplotlib
3)scipy

All of these libraries can be installed using pip, which is a package manager for Python. You can run the following commands in your terminal
 r command prompt to install these libraries:

pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy

HOW TO RUN CODE
---------------

Once you have installed all the dependencies, please run the "BuildMorseSmaleComplex.py" file using python or python3 command.
We have built a user interface that will ask you which function you need to build Morse Smale Complex for, once you input your 
choice, our code will generate the Morse Smale Complex which can be visible in new window that opens.

We have also provided "VisualiseMorseSmaleComplex.py" in which we have colored each quadrangle of Morse Smale Complex in a 
different color. This is an additional effort from our side where we have put in the critical points obtained and created a 
visual representation of the Morse Smale Complex
